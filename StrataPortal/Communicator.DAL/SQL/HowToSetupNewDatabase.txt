1. Create the DB
	- locally you can use 'databaseSetup.sql'
	- In Azure, login to the portal and create a new DB from there
2. Ensure the database has a user, AARockend, pwd diamond 
3. Run 2.DbUpdaterSetup.sql
4. Configure DbUpdater with the new database details
	- Add new ConnectionString to app.config
		(note that the environment must map to an environment)
5. Run DbUpdater, passing in the environment specified in step 3 and the path (iRock directory)
	- note: If any of the scripts fail then all will be rolled back

Done!
