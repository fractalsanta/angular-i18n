I'm not setting this db up with dbUpdater because I don't expect it to change at all,
plus easier to just use the one session state db across all environments (doesn't matter
if all environments share the same state db...that I can think of)

Scripts can be used to setup a new db if need be (eg on your local dev machine).
To setup in Azure dont run the ASPStateInstall script, it just creates the db which 
needs to be done manually on SQL Azure.

In Azure the State code was producing this error:
Unable to cast object of type 'System.DBNull' to type 'System.Byte[]'
if the size of the session data was 'big'.
