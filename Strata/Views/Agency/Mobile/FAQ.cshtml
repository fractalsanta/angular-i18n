            <dt>Can anyone else see my reports?</dt>
            <dd>The only way to access your reports is to log in via this website using the login
            details provided to you by your Manager. As a precaution it is recommended that
            you do not share these login details with anyone.

            <dt>I paid my levies earlier today. When will that payment appear on my current owner
            account?</dt>
            <dd>The information is updated automatically when the transaction is processed by your
            Manager. Payments that were made electronically (EFT, BPAY) will show on your ledger
            when the transaction appears on your the agent's bank statement and after it has
            been processed by them. Payments made electronically on Fridays, weekends or public
            holidays can take longer to appear on the ledger.</dd>

            <dt>What type of transactions will I be able to see on my reports?</dt>
            <dd>The information that is available from this portal website is a duplicate of what
            is provided by your Manager produced in their office.</dd>
